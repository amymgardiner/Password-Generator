# Password Generator

This application was developed for employees to use to generate a random password based on criteria theyâ€™ve selected. This app will run in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that I have written. The HTML and CSS were already provided for me, as well as the ending code on the JavaScript js page. The starter code insured that it had a simple user interface that is responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.
