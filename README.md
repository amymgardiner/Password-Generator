# Password Generator

This application was developed for employees to use to generate a random password based on criteria theyâ€™ve selected. This app will run in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that I have written. The HTML and CSS were already provided for me, as well as the ending code on the JavaScript js page. The starter code insured that it had a simple user interface that is responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.

## How the Application Works

When you clock the button to generate a password, then you are presented with a series of prompts for password criteria.

Once you are prompted for the password criteria, then you can select which criteria to include in the password. The first promt asks you for the length and you can choose a length of a least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters. The next few prompts ask you what character types you want to include in the password, and you can confirm wheater or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters. After each prompt, your input will be validated and at least one of the chacter types you need will be selected.

After all the prompts are answered, your password will generate and display in the "Your Secure Password" box. Your new password should match all of your selected or unselected criteria.
